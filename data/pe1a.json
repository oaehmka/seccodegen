It checks if the number of bytes exceeds the buffer size before copying the bytes using `memcpy`. The destination buffer is then null-terminated to ensure proper string handling.\n\nIn the `main` function, it demonstrates how to use the `copyBytes` function to copy a message from the source buffer to the destination buffer and print the result.",
